# ChatGPTImp-Console

The AI Prototype will test/showcase a mobile application's ability to call and interact with an OpenAI/ChatGPT Model

Functions Tested: Permission via Manifest / API Call / Return Content
	
## What does the Prototype do?

This prototype works as a simple prompt and response chat client.

## What are its problems?

The response cushion is not interactable. Cant adjust the training or token count at the moment.  
Adjusting this would be easy, but not worth the effort for this prototype. 
	
Prototype has a very long wait time without any indication of what is happening. 
The type is fed into a dynamic and returned as a string. 
The response is a completed JSON opposed to a set of partial JSON set. Perhaps I can Adjust this.

## What from it can I transfer?
The whole API calls. The GPT returns content that I would need for the 

Sample Prompt Given to it: Create a C# Black Jack game
Results: It works! I created a 2nd project in the repository that holds the game. The first response was 
limited by input tokens, but after making adjustments, the second one worked great!
